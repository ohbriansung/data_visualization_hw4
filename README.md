# San Francisco Fire Department Calls for Service

This is a Github Pages repository setup for [CS 360/560 Data Visualization](/) for the Spring 2019 term at the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/).

The initial template supports [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/), [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io/), and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons. However, none of these are required and may be changed.

Feel free to use this template as-is or modify _without_ attribution. Other CSS frameworks or built-in Github Pages templates may be used instead of what is provided here, and files may be added, edited, removed as necessary.

For an example of how this template will render, see:
